## Getting Started

To get started with the AI-Powered PR Description Generator, follow the instructions below to set up your environment and configure the project.

## Installation

- Prerequisites
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or above)
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)

- Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-powered-pr-description-generator.git
   cd ai-powered-pr-description-generator
   ```

- Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install & npm run build
   ```
   
## Configuration
Before using the generator, you need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings(https://github.com/your-repo/settings/secrets/actions):

- GEMINI_API_KEY: Your API key for the Gemini model.
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Your API key for the OpenAI model (if applicable).

GITHUB_TOKEN should be required (https://github.com/settings/tokens), it needs permission to modify the pull request.

### Action Inputs
- `ai_name` (required): Which provider to use. Supported: `gemini`, `open-ai`.
- `api_key` (required): API key for the selected provider.
- `temperature` (optional): Creativity (0.0â€“1.0). Default: `0.7`.
- `ignores` (optional): Comma-separated paths to ignore in diffs.
- `use_jira` (optional): Enable Jira ticket extraction from branch. Default: `false`.
- `ai_model` (optional): Model to use. Default depends on `ai_name`:
  - `gemini` -> `gemini-1.5-pro` (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`)
  - `open-ai` -> `gpt-4.1` (e.g., `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`)
- `update_title` (optional): When `true`, also generates and updates the PR title. Default: `false`.


## Usage
Once configured, the action will automatically execute whenever a pull request is created or a commit is pushed to the repository.

## GitHub Workflow
Here's an example of how to set up your GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/description-generator.yml):

```yaml
name: PR Description

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  describe:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate PR description (Gemini)
        if: env.AI_PROVIDER == 'gemini'
        uses: your-username/ai-powered-pr-description-generator@v1
        with:
          ai_name: gemini
          api_key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          temperature: '0.7'
          # Choose a model (defaults to gemini-1.5-pro for gemini)
          ai_model: gemini-2.5-flash
          # Also update the PR title
          update_title: 'true'
          # Optional: ignore some paths
          ignores: 'package-lock.json, dist/**'

      - name: Generate PR description (OpenAI)
        if: env.AI_PROVIDER == 'openai'
        uses: your-username/ai-powered-pr-description-generator@v1
        with:
          ai_name: open-ai
          api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          temperature: '0.7'
          # Choose a model (defaults to gpt-4.1 for open-ai)
          ai_model: gpt-4.1
          update_title: 'true'
          ignores: 'package-lock.json, dist/**'
```

Tip: set provider and models at the top of your workflow via `env`:

```yaml
env:
  AI_PROVIDER: gemini # or 'openai'
  AI_MODEL: gemini-2.5-flash # optional; defaults by provider
```

## Supported AI Models
The project currently supports the following AI models for generating descriptions:

- Gemini: An AI model that provides concise and relevant descriptions for pull requests.
- OpenAI: A more advanced AI model that can generate detailed and nuanced descriptions.
You can configure which AI model to use in your workflow settings.
